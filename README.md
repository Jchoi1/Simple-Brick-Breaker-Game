# Simple-Brick-Breaker-Game

Made this with tutorial from Martin Yanev from Udemy

simple brick breaker game with score counting and restart capbilities.
Overall this was my first experience having to read documentation of imported libraries that I wasn't familiar with.
I have found a bug within the code as i tried playing the game and currently the game plays out the exact same way each round.
  The bug was when the ball would hit and destroy mulitple bricks within its straight line of path without returning back towards the user.
It was cool to build a project that pulled up a seperate window outside the IDE unlike all my other previously made code projects and labs.

I think in the future I'd like to come back and try to fix that bug that I found and also expand the randomness of each round, possibly making more levels in the future.
